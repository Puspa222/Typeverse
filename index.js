str1=`Your experience as you look at the woman's face seamlessly combines what we normally call seeing and intuitive thinking. As surely and quickly as
you saw that the young woman's hair is dark, you knew she is angry.
Furthermore, what you saw extended into the future. You sensed that this woman is about to say some very unkind words, probably in a loud and
strident voice. A premonition of what she was going to do next came to mind automatically and effortlessly. You did not intend to assess her mood
or to anticipate what she might do, and your reaction to the picture did not
have the feel of something you did. It just happened to you. It was an
instance of fast thinking. You knew immediately that this is a multiplication problem, and probably
knew that you could solve it, with paper and pencil, if not without. You also
had some vague intuitive knowledge of the range of possible results. You would be quick to recognize that both 12,609 and 123 are implausible. Without spending some time on the problem, however, you would not be
certain that the answer is not 568.A precise solution did not come to mind,
and you felt that you could choose whether or not to engage in the
computation. If you have not done so yet, you should attempt the multiplication problem now, completing at least part of it. You experienced slow thinking as you proceeded through a sequence of
steps. You first retrieved from memory the cognitive program for multiplication that you learned in school, then you implemented it. Carrying
out the computation was a strain. You felt the burden of holding much material in memory, as you needed to keep track of where you were and of where you were going, while holding on to the intermediate result. The
process was mental work: deliberate, effortful, and orderly--a prototype of
slow thinking. The computation was not only an event in your mind; your
body was also involved. Your muscles tensed up, your blood pressure
rose, and your heart rate increased. Someone looking closely at your eyes while you tackled this problem would have seen your pupils dilate. Your
pupils contracted back to normal size as soon as you ended your work--
when you found the answer (which is 408, by the way) or when you gave
up. All these mental events belong with the angry woman--they occur
automatically and require little or no effort. The capabilities of System 1
include innate skills that we share with other animals. We are born
prepared to perceive the world around us, recognize objects, orient
attention, avoid losses, and fear spiders. Other mental activities become
fast and automatic through prolonged practice. System 1 has learned
associations between ideas (the capital of France?); it has also learned
skills such as reading and understanding nuances of social situations. Some skills, such as finding strong chess moves, are acquired only by
specialized experts. Others are widely shared. Detecting the similarity of a
personality sketch to an occupatiohein occupatnal stereotype requires
broad knowledge of the language and the culture, which most of us
possess. The knowledge is stored in memory and accessed without
intention and without effort. Several of the mental actions in the list are completely involuntary. You
cannot refrain from understanding simple sentences in your own language
or from orienting to a loud unexpected sound, nor can you prevent yourself
from knowing that 2 + 2 = 4 or from thinking of Paris when the capital of
France is mentioned. Other activities, such as chewing, are susceptible to
voluntary control but normally run on automatic pilot. The control of attention
is shared by the two systems. Orienting to a loud sound is normally an
involuntary operation of System 1, which immediately mobilizes the
voluntary attention of System 2. You may be able to resist turning toward
the source of a loud and offensive comment at a crowded party, but even if
your head does not move, your attention is initially directed to it, at least for
a while. However, attention can be moved away from an unwanted focus,
primarily by focusing intently on another target.
The highly diverse operations of System 2 have one feature in common:
they require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away. Here are some examples:
If you wish to experience your System 2 working at full tilt, the following
exercise will do; it should you to the limits of your cognitive
abilities within 5 seconds. To start, make up several strings of 4 digits, all
different, and write each string on an index card. Place a blank card on top
of the deck. The task that you will perform is called Add-1. Here is how it
goes:
Start beating a steady rhythm (or better yet, set a metronome at
1/sec). Remove the blank card and read the four digits aloud. Wait for two beats, then report a string in which each of the
original digits is incremented by 1. If the digits on the card are
5294, the correct response is 6305. Keeping the rhythm is
important.
Few people can cope with more than four digits in the Add-1 task, but if
you want a harder challenge, please try Add-3.
If you would like to know what your body is doing while your mind is hard
at work, set up two piles of books on a sturdy table, place a video camera
on one and lean your chin on the other, get the video going, and stare at
the camera lens while you work on Add-1 or Add-3 exercises. Later, you will find in the changing size of your pupils a faithful record of how hard you worked.
I have a long personal history with the Add-1 task. Early in my career I
spent a year at the University of Michigan, as a visitor in a laboratory that
studied hypnosis. Casting about for a useful topic of research, I found an
article in Scientific American in which the psychologist Eckhard Hess
described the pupil of the eye as a window to the soul. I reread it recently
and again found it inspiring. It begins with Hess reporting that his wife had
noticed his pupils widening as he watched beautiful nature pictures, and it
ends with two striking pictures of the same good-looking woman, who
somehow appears much more attractive in one than in the other. There is
only one difference: the pupils of the eyes appear dilated in the attractive
picture and constricted in the other. Hess also wrote of belladonna, a pupildilating substance that was used as a cosmetic, and of bazaar shoppers who wear dark glasses in order to hide their level of interest from
merchants. Beatty and I focused on paced tasks, such as Add-1, in which we knew
precisely what was on the subject's mind at any time. We recorded strings
of digits on beats of the metronome and instructed the subject to repeat or
transform the digits one indigits onby one, maintaining the same rhythm. We soon discovered that the size of the pupil varied second by second,
reflecting the changing demands of the task. The shape of the response was an inverted V. As you experienced it if you tried Add-1 or Add-3, effort
builds up with every added digit that you hear, reaches an almost
intolerable peak as you rush to produce a transformed string during and
immediately after the pause, and relaxes gradually as you "unload" your
short-term memory. The pupil data corresponded precisely to subjective
experience: longer strings reliably caused larger dilations, the
transformation task compounded the effort, and the peak of pupil size
coincided with maximum effort. Add-1 with four digits caused a larger
dilation than the task of holding seven digits for immediate recall. Add-3, which is much more difficult, is the most demanding that I ever observed. In
the first 5 seconds, the pupil dilates by about 50% of its original area and
heart rate increases by about 7 beats per minute. This is as hard as
people can work--they give up if more is asked of them. When we
exposed our subjects to more digits than they could remember, their pupils
stopped dilating or actually shrank. We worked for some months in a spacious basement suite in which we
had set up a closed-circuit system that projected an image of the subject's
pupil on a screen in the corridor; we also could hear what was happening
in the laboratory. The diameter of the projected pupil was about a foot; watching it dilate and contract when the participant was at work was a
fascinating sight, quite an attraction for visitors in our lab. We amused
ourselves and impressed our guests by our ability to divine when the
participant gave up on a task. During a mental multiplication, the pupil
normally dilated to a large size within a few seconds and stayed large as
long as the individual kept working on the problem; it contracted
immediately when she found a solution or gave up. As we watched from
the corridor, we would sometimes surprise both the owner of the pupil and
our guests by asking, "Why did you stop working just now?" The answer
from inside the lab was often, "How did you know?" to which we would
reply, "We have a window to your soul. I spend a few months each year in Berkeley, and one of my great
pleasures there is a daily four-mile walk on a marked path in the hills, with
a fine view of San Francisco Bay. I usually keep track of my time and have
learned a fair amount about effort from doing so. I have found a speed,
about 17 minutes for a mile, which I experience as a stroll. I certainly exert
physical effort and burn more calories at that speed than if I sat in a
recliner, but I experience no strain, no conflict, and no need to push myself.
I am also able to think and work while walking at that rate. Indeed, I suspect
that the mild physical arousal of the walk may spill over into greater mental
alertness. System 2 also has a natural speed. You expend some mental energy in
random thoughts and in monitoring what goes on around you even when
your mind does nothing in particular, but there is little strain. Unless you are
in a situation that makes you unusually wary or self-conscious, monitoring what happens in the environment or inside your head demands little effort. You make many small decisions as you drive your car, absorb some
information as you read the newspaper, and conduct routine exchanges of
pleasantries with a spouse or a colleague, all with little effort and no strain.
Just like a stroll.
It is normally easy and actually quite pleasant to walk and think at the
same time, but at the extremes these activities appear to compete for the
limited resources of System 2. You can confirm this claim by a simple
experiment. While walking comfortably with a friend, ask him to compute
23 * 78 in his head, and to do so immediately. He will almost certainly stop
in his tracks. My experience is that I can think while strolling but cannot
engage in mental work that imposes a heavy load on short-term memory. If
I must construct an intricate argument under time pressure, I would rather
be still, and I would prefer sitting to standing. Of course, not all slow
thinking requires that form of intense concentration and effortful
computation--I did the best thinking of my life on leisurely walks with
Amos. Accelerating beyond my strolling speed completely changes the
experience of walking, because the transition to a faster walk brings about
a sharp deterioration in my ability to think coherently. As I speed up, my
attention is drawn with increasing frequency to the experience of walking
and to the deliberate maintenance of the faster pace. My ability to bring a
train of thought to a conclusion is impaired accordingly. At the highest
speed I can sustain on the hills, about 14 minutes for a mile, I do not even
try to think of anything else. In addition to the physical effort of moving my
body rapidly along the path, a mental effort of self-control is needed to
resist the urge to slow down. Self-control and deliberate thought apparently
draw on the same limited budget of effort.
For most of us, most of the time, the maintenance of a coherent train of
thought and the occasional engagement in effortful thinking also require
self-control. Although I have not conducted a systematic survey, I suspect
that frequent switching of tasks and speeded-up mental work are not
intrinsically pleasurable, and that people avoid them when possible. This is
how the law of least effort comes to be a law. Even in the absence of time
pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline. An
observer of the number of times I look at e-mail or investigate the
refrigerator during an hour of writing could wahene dd reasonably infer an
urge to escape and conclude that keeping at it requires more self-control
than I can readily muster.
Fortunately, cognitive work is not always aversive, and people
sometimes expend considerable effort for long periods of time without
having to exert willpower. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
(pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this
state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has
become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as
"a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of
time, of themselves, of their problems," and their descriptions of the joy of
that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an "optimal
experience." Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to
racing motorcycles-and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a
book is often an optimal experience. Flow neatly separates the two forms
of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game
of chess are certainly very effortful. In a state of flow, however, maintaining
focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of selfcontrol, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand. `;

str2=`Living in today's diverse world presents us with a myriad of experiences, each contributing to the rich tapestry of human life. Urban environments, for instance, are characterized by their towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and constant activity. These cities, with their shimmering glass buildings and crowded public transportation systems, reflect the relentless pace of modern life. They are hubs of commerce, culture, and innovation, drawing people from various backgrounds to their vibrant centers. Parks and green spaces, nestled amidst the concrete jungle, offer a sanctuary where people can unwind and connect with nature. These urban oases, with their manicured lawns, playgrounds, and benches, are places where families gather, children play, and individuals find a moment of peace in an otherwise hectic environment. The countryside, in stark contrast, provides a serene escape from the chaos of city life. Its rolling hills, vast fields, and quiet forests offer a slower, more reflective pace of life. In rural areas, one can find a sense of tranquility, where the rhythm of daily life is dictated by the seasons and the natural world. Farms, with their red barns and sprawling fields, are common sights, showcasing a lifestyle rooted in agriculture and close-knit communities. The beauty of the countryside lies in its simplicity and its deep connection to the land. Coastal areas, with their golden beaches and endless ocean horizons, offer yet another distinct experience. The sound of waves crashing against the shore, the salty breeze, and the warm sand beneath one's feet create a unique sensory experience. Beaches are places of recreation and relaxation, where people swim, surf, build sandcastles, and bask in the sun. The coastal environment fosters a deep appreciation for the natural world and its many wonders. Meanwhile, mountain regions provide a breathtakingly different kind of beauty. Their towering peaks, often capped with snow, offer opportunities for hiking, skiing, and mountaineering. The crisp mountain air, the stunning vistas, and the challenge of the climb appeal to those seeking adventure and a closer connection to nature. Each of these environments, whether urban, rural, coastal, or mountainous, presents its own set of experiences and opportunities for exploration and enjoyment.
The advancement of technology has profoundly impacted every aspect of our lives, bridging the gaps between these diverse environments and connecting people in unprecedented ways. Smartphones, computers, and the internet have become integral to daily life, providing access to information, entertainment, and communication. These technologies enable people to stay connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. Social media platforms, video calls, and instant messaging have made it possible to maintain relationships and share experiences in real-time. Additionally, the internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, offering resources for education, research, and personal growth. Online courses, digital libraries, and educational websites provide opportunities for lifelong learning and skill development. In the realm of entertainment, streaming services, online games, and digital music platforms offer endless options for relaxation and enjoyment. Technology has also revolutionized the way we work, with remote work becoming increasingly common. Virtual meetings, collaborative online tools, and digital workspaces have made it possible for people to work from anywhere, fostering a more flexible and dynamic approach to employment. The impact of technology extends to transportation as well, with innovations such as electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and ride-sharing apps transforming the way we travel. These advancements not only make transportation more efficient but also contribute to environmental sustainability. The rapid development of technology continues to shape our world, creating new possibilities and enhancing our ability to connect, learn, and explore.
Transportation, in its various forms, plays a crucial role in connecting different parts of the world and facilitating the movement of people and goods. In urban areas, public transportation systems such as buses, subways, and trams are essential for daily commutes and reducing traffic congestion. These systems are often complemented by alternative modes of transport like bicycles and electric scooters, which promote sustainable and healthy living. In rural areas, cars, tractors, and bicycles are the primary means of transportation, reflecting the agricultural lifestyle and the need for mobility across vast distances. For longer journeys, airplanes and trains provide fast and efficient travel options. Air travel has made it possible to traverse continents in a matter of hours, while high-speed trains offer a convenient alternative for intercity travel. These advancements in transportation not only enhance connectivity but also contribute to economic growth and cultural exchange. The logistics industry, powered by an extensive network of roads, railways, and shipping routes, ensures the timely delivery of goods across the globe. The evolution of transportation continues to push boundaries, with innovations such as autonomous vehicles, hyperloop systems, and space travel on the horizon. These developments promise to further revolutionize the way we move and interact with the world.
Animals, both domestic and wild, are an integral part of our world, contributing to the biodiversity and ecological balance of our planet. Pets like dogs, cats, and birds bring joy and companionship to millions of households, becoming beloved members of families. They provide emotional support, encourage physical activity, and enhance overall well-being. In the wild, animals play vital roles in maintaining ecosystems and supporting biodiversity. Predators such as lions and wolves help control prey populations, ensuring a healthy balance in the food chain. Herbivores like deer and elephants contribute to the maintenance of vegetation and the dispersal of seeds. The diversity of animal life, from the smallest insects to the largest mammals, is a testament to the richness of our natural world. Conservation efforts are crucial in protecting endangered species and preserving habitats. Zoos, wildlife sanctuaries, and marine parks play an important role in educating the public about the importance of wildlife conservation and providing safe havens for threatened species.  `;

str3 = `education is very important for everyone. it is the foundation of our future. from a young age we start learning basic skills like reading writing and math. these basic skills are essential for daily life. without the ability to read we cannot understand signs menus or books. without writing we cannot communicate effectively through letters emails or text messages. math helps us manage money cook meals and plan our time.
as we grow older education becomes more detailed. we start learning about different subjects such as science history and geography. science teaches us about the natural world from the smallest atoms to the vast universe. we learn about plants animals and the human body. history helps us understand the past and how it has shaped our present. we learn about ancient civilizations important events and influential people. geography helps us learn about different places and cultures around the world. we learn about mountains rivers and countries. each subject helps us understand the world better and prepares us for life.
education is not just about gaining knowledge. it also helps us develop critical thinking skills. these skills are important for solving problems and making good decisions. for example when we learn math we not only learn how to add and subtract but also how to approach and solve complex problems. this ability to think critically is useful in everyday life whether we are planning a budget troubleshooting a computer issue or deciding the best route to take on a trip.
education also plays a crucial role in our personal development. it helps us develop values and ethics. we learn the importance of honesty hard work and perseverance. these values are essential for success in life. honesty helps us build trust with others. hard work enables us to achieve our goals. perseverance helps us overcome challenges and setbacks. education also helps us develop social skills. in school we interact with other students and teachers. we learn how to communicate effectively and work in teams. these skills are important in the workplace and in everyday life.
higher education such as college or university opens up even more opportunities. it allows us to specialize in a particular field of interest. this can lead to a rewarding career. for example someone who studies medicine can become a doctor and help save lives. someone who studies engineering can design buildings and infrastructure that benefit society. higher education also helps us develop advanced skills and knowledge that are highly valued in the job market. this can lead to better job opportunities and higher salaries.
education also has a significant impact on society as a whole. it helps reduce poverty and inequality. when people are educated they have better job opportunities. they can earn higher incomes and provide a better quality of life for their families. education also promotes economic growth. an educated workforce is essential for a strong economy. it drives innovation and productivity. educated people are more likely to start businesses create jobs and contribute to economic development.
moreover education promotes peace and stability. it helps people understand different perspectives and reduces conflicts. educated people are more likely to participate in democratic processes and make informed decisions. they are also more likely to be tolerant and understanding of others. education helps build a more just and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
education is also important for health and well-being. it helps people make informed decisions about their health. for example they learn about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise. they also learn about the dangers of smoking and substance abuse. educated people are more likely to seek medical care when they need it. they are also more likely to support public health measures such as vaccinations. this leads to healthier communities and a better quality of life for everyone.
education also promotes gender equality. it gives everyone the chance to learn and succeed regardless of their gender. educated women are more likely to participate in the workforce and contribute to economic development. they are also more likely to have healthier families and make better decisions for their children. education empowers women and helps break the cycle of poverty and inequality.
in summary education is the key to a better life for individuals and society. it helps us gain knowledge and skills develop values and ethics and make informed decisions. it opens up opportunities for better jobs and higher incomes. it promotes peace stability and economic growth. it improves health and well-being. it promotes gender equality and empowers people. education is essential for a better future for everyone. `;
